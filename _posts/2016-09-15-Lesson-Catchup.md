(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>

    <td>I learnt by emailing and talking with my peers and experimenting with my code to try to achieve the lesson target, I managed it relatively well as I was suggested a website (w3 schools) to help me and it was really useful. It gave me all the code I needed and told me where to put it. </td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I had a hard time when I was dealing with " syntax errors" , the problem with them is that when they come up as an error, they don't give you any information on why it has come up. Therefore I had to undergo a long process of trial and error before I finally found a solution.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I will hopefully be present for the lesson next time and I will complete the homework/catching up the night I get it.</td>
