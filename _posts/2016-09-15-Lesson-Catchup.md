    <td>I learnt by emailing and talking with my peers and experimenting with my code to try to achieve the lesson target, I managed it relatively well as I was suggested a website (w3 schools) to help me and it was really useful. It gave me all the code I needed and told me where to put it.</td>

    <th>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Playing rugby firstly, secondly not going to see leaving it to the last minute to catch up as it was all very rushed and I probably could 've caught up better.  Therefore I could probably work on collaboration with others.</td>

    <th>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will hopefully be present for the lesson next time and I will complete the homework/catching up the night I get it.</td>
