    <td>I learnt by, first listening to the teacher and taking notes on my ipad and then transferring (from my ipad and memory) what the teacher has taught me. I did this when I was editing the code, adding a profile picture and a background. I did find this strategy effective, however I could've taken more notes so I could remember more effectively.</td>

    <td>I need to work alone more effectively as I often needed others help to make my blog go online as there was often a problem with the coding.</td>

    <td>I will take more notes and try to make sure that I plan my lesson better so I can do each section well and make it work. I also need to be able to think flexibly so when it goes wrong for me I can fix it and approach the problem from a different direction.</td>
